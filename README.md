Rocketman is a gem that introduces Pub-Sub mechanism within your Ruby code.

The main goal of Rocketman is not to replace proper message buses like Redis PubSub/Kafka, but rather be a stepping stone. You can read more about the rationale behind the project down below.

As with all Pub-Sub mechanism, this greatly decouples your upstream producer and downstream consumer, allowing for scalability, and easier refactor when you decide to move Pub-Sub to a separate service.

Rocketman also works without Rails.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rocketman'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rocketman

## Usage

Rocketman exposes two module, `Rocketman::Producer` and `Rocketman::Consumer`. They do exactly as what their name implies. All you need to do is `include Rocketman::Producer` and `extend Rocketman::Consumer` into your code.

### Producer
Producer exposes one **instance** method to you: `:emit`. `:emit` takes in the event name and an optional payload and publishes it to the consumers. There's nothing more you need to do. The producer do not have to know who its consumers are.

```ruby
class Producer
  include Rocketman::Producer

  def hello_world
    emit :hello, payload: {"one" => 1, "two" => 2}
  end
end
```

Note that Producer emit events with threads that run in a thread pool. The default number of worker is 5, and the workers default to checking the job with a 3 seconds interval. You can tweak these to your liking, refer to the [`Configuration` section](https://github.com/edisonywh/rocketman#configuration) below for more informations.

### Consumer
Consumer exposes a **class** method, `:on_event`. `:on_event` takes in the event name, and also an additional block, which gets executed whenever a message is received. If an additional `payload` is emitted along with the event, you can get access to it in the form of block argument.

```ruby
class Consumer
  extend Rocketman::Consumer

  on_event :hello do |payload|
    puts "I've received #{payload} here!"
    # => I've received {:payload=>{"one"=>1, "two"=>2}} here!
  end
end
```

Simple isn't it?

#### Consume events from external services

If you want to also consume events from external services, you're in luck (well, as long as you're using `Redis` anyway..)

Rocketman exposes a `Rocketman::Bridge`, which allows your Ruby code to start consuming events from Redis, **without any changes to your consumers**.

This works because `Bridge` will listen for events from those services on behalf of you, and then it'll push those events onto the internal `Registry`.

**This pattern is powerful because this means your consumers do not have to know where the events are coming from, as long as they're registed onto `Registry`.**

Right now, only `Redis` is supported. Assuming you have the `redis` gem installed, this is how you register a bridge.

```ruby
Rocketman::Bridge.construct(Redis.new)
```

That's all! Rocketman will translate the following

```
redis-cli> PUBLISH hello payload
```

to something understandable by your consumer, so a consumer only has to do:

```ruby
on_event :hello do |payload|
  puts payload
end
```

Notice how it behaves exactly the same as if the events did not come from Redis :)

**NOTE**: You should always pass in a **new, dedicated** connection to `Redis` to `Bridge#construct`. This is because `redis.subscribe` will hog the whole Redis connection (not just Ruby process), so `Bridge` expects a dedicated connection for itself.

## Persisting emitted events

By default, the events emitted from your app will be stored in an in-memory `Queue`, which will get processed by Rocketman threaded workers.

However this also means that if your app dies with events still in your job queue, your emitted events which are stored in-memory will be lost.

That is obviously not desirable, so that's why **Rocketman ships with an option to use `Redis` as your backing storage mechanism.**

All you need to do is pass in a `Redis` connection to Rocketman. Refer to the [`Configuration` section below](https://github.com/edisonywh/rocketman#configuration) for more information.

## Configuration

Here are the available options to tweak for Rocketman.

```ruby
# config/initializers/rocketman.rb

Rocketman.configure do |config|
  config.worker_count = 10 # defaults to 5
  config.latency      = 1  # defaults to 3, unit is :seconds
  config.storage      = Redis.new # defaults to `nil`
  config.debug        = true # defaults to `false`
end
```

Currently `storage` only supports `Redis`, suggestions for alternative backing mechanisms are welcomed.

`debug` mode enables some debugging `puts` statements, and also tweak the `Thread` workers to `abort_on_exception = true`. So if you have failing jobs, this is how you can figure out what's happening inside your workers.

## Why use `Rocketman`, rather than a proper message bus (e.g Redis PubSub/Kafka)?

It is worth noting that `Rocketman` is not meant to be a replacement for the aforementioned projects -- both Redis PubSub and Kafka are battle-tested and I highly encourage to use them if you can.

**But**, `Rocketman` recognizes that it's not an easy task to spin up an external message bus to support event-driven architecture, and that's what it's trying to do - to be a stepping stone for eventual greatness.

Moving onto a event-driven architecture is not an easy task - your team has to agree on a message bus, the DevOps team needs the capacity to manage the message bus, and then what about clustering? failovers?

So what Rocketman offers you is that you can start writing your dream-state event-driven code **today**, and when the time comes and your team has the capacity to move to a different message bus, then it should be a minimal change.

## Roadmap

Right now events are using a `fire-and-forget` mechanism, which is designed to not cause issue to producers. However, this also means that if a consumer fail to consume an event, it'll be lost forever. **Next thing on the roadmap is look into a retry strategy + persistence mechanism.**

~~Emitted events are also stored in memory in `Rocketman::Pool`, which means that there's a chance that you'll lose all emitted jobs. Something to think about is to perhaps move the emitted events/job queue onto a persistent storage, like Redis for example.~~ **Redis support is now available!**

The interface could also probably be better defined, as one of the goal of Rocketman is to be the stepping stone before migrating off to a real, proper message queue/pub-sub mechanism like Kafka. **I want to revisit and think about how can we make that transition more seamless.**

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Why is it called Rocketman?

Uh.. well it's named after the song by Elton John, but really, it has nothing to do with an actual Rocketman.
